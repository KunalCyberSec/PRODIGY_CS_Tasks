Creating a packet sniffer can provide valuable insights into network activity for educational and security purposes, such as network troubleshooting and auditing. 
However, it is crucial to emphasize that packet sniffing should only be done with explicit permission, as unauthorized use can violate privacy and security laws.

This is a packet sniffer using Python with the scapy library. The program will capture packets on a specified network interface and display information such as the source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.

Ethical Considerations:
  1. Only use this tool on networks you own or have permission to monitor.
  2. Do not intercept private or sensitive data on unauthorized networks.

Install Required Library:

We will use the Scapy library, which is widely used for packet sniffing and network traffic analysis.

  Install it by running:
	"pip install scapy"

Explanation:

Packet Handler Function:

1. The packet_handler function processes each packet that is captured. It checks if the packet is an IP packet and extracts details such as:

	a. Source and Destination IP addresses.
	
 	b. Transport layer protocols: TCP, UDP, ICMP, and others.

	c. Source and Destination Ports (for TCP/UDP).

	d. Payload (raw data) of the packet.

Sniffing Network Traffic:

1. The sniff function from scapy captures packets on the specified network interface. It passes each packet to packet_handler to be analyzed and printed.

2. The interface can be specified (e.g., eth0 for wired Ethernet or wlan0 for Wi-Fi).

Protocols:

1. The tool recognizes common transport protocols like TCP, UDP, and ICMP and prints relevant information.

2. If a packet uses a different protocol, the tool will still display its payload.

User Interaction:

1. The user is prompted to enter the network interface to sniff on. The program then starts capturing packets from that interface.

Running the Program:

1. On a Linux system, you may need to run the script with sudo to capture network packets:

		sudo python packet_sniffer.py

2. Provide the appropriate network interface (e.g., wlan0 for Wi-Fi or eth0 for Ethernet).

Ethical Guidelines:

1. Always obtain explicit permission before monitoring any network traffic.

2. Ensure that you are following all legal and ethical guidelines when conducting network traffic analysis.

3. Avoid intercepting or capturing sensitive information like personal data or credentials unless you have explicit consent for ethical hacking or auditing purposes.
