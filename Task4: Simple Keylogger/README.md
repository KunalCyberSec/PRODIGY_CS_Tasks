Creating keyloggers is a sensitive topic, and their use must be approached with extreme caution due to potential legal and ethical concerns. 
Keyloggers should only be used with the explicit consent of the user or system owner, such as in security audits or parental monitoring. 
Unauthorized use of keyloggers can violate privacy laws and other regulations.

This Python program captures keystrokes and logs them into a text file. We will use the pynput library to capture keyboard events.

Important:
1. Ensure you have permission before using keyloggers.
2. Use keyloggers responsibly and within the boundaries of the law.

Install the Required Library:
"pip install pynput"

Explanation:

1. Logging setup:
  The logging module is configured to log keystrokes to a file named key_log.txt. Each key press is logged with a timestamp.
2. Key capturing:
  The pynput.keyboard.Listener is used to capture key presses in real-time. The on_press function is triggered for each key pressed, and the key is logged.
3. Logging key presses:
  The on_press function logs the keys as they are pressed. Each key is converted to a string and logged in the format Key.<key> (for special keys like Key.space for spacebar).
4. Running the keylogger:
  The keylogger runs in the background by calling listener.join(). This ensures it captures all key presses as long as the script is active.
5. Stopping the Keylogger:
  You can stop the keylogger by manually terminating the program (e.g., using Ctrl + C in the terminal).

#Important Notes:#
1. Use a keylogger only for educational purposes or in situations where you have explicit permission.

2. Misuse of such tools can lead to serious legal consequences. Always ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.
